# NEAT-TCP: Generation of TCP Congestion Control through Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies for Wireless Multi-Hop Networks

This project (Bachelor-Thesis) modifies a [**NEAT implementation**](https://github.com/FernandoTorres/NEAT) to generate a TCP Congestion Control Algorithm for a given Communication Network Topology. It includes a fork for ns-3.27 in the implementation folder and the written thesis about this project.

## Thesis

Here you can find the written thesis in .tex and .pdf format.

## Implementation

In this folder the implementations are located.
